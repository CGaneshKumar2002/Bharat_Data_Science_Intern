# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the field of financial analysis. Accurate predictions can provide valuable insights for investors and traders to make informed decisions. In this project, we leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting.

## Project Overview
1. **Importing the Dependencies**: To begin the project, we need to import the necessary libraries and modules. Some of the key dependencies include pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for data visualization, and tensorflow for building and training the LSTM model.

2. **Dataset Collection**: We obtain the stock price dataset for a specific company. This dataset contains historical stock prices, such as open, high, low, close, and volume. For our prediction task, we focus on analyzing the closing prices.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Before diving into modeling, it is crucial to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize the data using line plots, candlestick charts, or other techniques to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the stock prices.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the dataset is an essential step to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the LSTM model. This involves tasks such as scaling the data, handling missing values or outliers, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Network Training**: The LSTM network is constructed with multiple layers, including LSTM layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. We define the network architecture and specify parameters such as the number of LSTM units, activation functions, and dropout rates. The model is trained using the training dataset, and the weights are optimized through backpropagation and gradient descent.

6. **Prediction**: Once the LSTM model is trained, we utilize it to make predictions on the testing dataset. The model takes historical stock price data as input and generates predictions for future stock prices. These predictions can provide valuable insights for decision-making and portfolio management.

7. **Evaluation**: To assess the performance of our LSTM model, we evaluate it using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score. These metrics quantify the accuracy of our predictions and help us understand the model's performance compared to the actual stock prices.

## Conclusion
Stock price prediction using LSTM is a fascinating application of neural networks in the field of finance. By leveraging the temporal dependencies captured by LSTM, we can make predictions on future stock prices, enabling investors and traders to make informed decisions. This project provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement stock price prediction using LSTM, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. However, it is essential to remember that stock market predictions are inherently uncertain, and accurate predictions depend on various factors. Therefore, the predictions made by the LSTM model should be used as a tool for analysis and not as financial advice.
